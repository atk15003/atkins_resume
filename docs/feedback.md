Your resume looks great! Here are a couple of suggestions.

#### VMock
Use [VMock](https://www.vmock.com/byui)! It is sooo helpful and its free for byui students. 

#### Action Verbs
It is good practice to start each bullet point with a strong action verb. In your sales section for example, re-word "Number of contracts sold totaled to 271 both summers combined" to say "Sold a total of 271 contracts during both summers." 

#### Succict Bullet Points
Some of your bullet points seem a little wordy. Try to keep them succint and to the point! For example, 
"First summer in Houston, out of 43 sales reps on my team that started out, I finished in the 76th percentile as far as number of contracts sold," could be rewritten as "Achieved the 76th percentile in contracts sold among the 43 members of my team."
